            <p>Greetings!</p>
            <br />
            <p>I'm Turhan Kimbrough, a software engineer with a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science from Towson University, where I first discovered my passion for deep learning. During grad school, I published multiple research papers in top venues like IEEE. While working with the Department of Defense, I began focusing on generative AI, integrating advanced models to support real-time decision-making for soldiers in the field. Today, I continue to build intelligent systems that push the boundaries of what AI can do.</p>
