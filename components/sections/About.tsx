              I'm Turhan Kimbrough, a software engineer with a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science from Towson University, where I first discovered my passion for deep learning. <br/><br/>
              
               During graduate school, I published multiple research papers in top venues like IEEE. <br/><br/> 
               
               While working with the Department of Defense, I began focusing on generative AI, integrating advanced models to support real-time decision-making for soldiers in the field. <br/><br/>
               
               Today, I continue to build products that push the boundaries of what AI can do.</p>
